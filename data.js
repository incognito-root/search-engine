        "Your iPhone comes with a powerful markup tool, making it easy to add annotations to documents and photos. This feature, available across several iOS apps, can be accessed in Photos by tapping the edit button and selecting the markup icon. Similarly, the markup tools appear when you take a screenshot, letting you add arrows or scribbles before saving. You can also find markup options in apps like Files, where you can annotate PDFs or add signatures. The tools include pens, an eraser, a ruler, and a selection tool, along with options to change colors, transparency, and line size. Additional tools like stickers, text, and shapes can be accessed via the plus button, enabling you to drop arrows, labels, or emojis onto images and documents. With shapes, you can adjust the fill and outline colors or add text by double-tapping. Snap-to-shapes allows you to turn rough drawings into perfect forms, and the undo button lets you correct mistakes. Once you’re satisfied, tap 'Done' to save your annotations. This feature is perfect for personal or professional tasks, offering flexibility and simplicity in editing photos and documents directly on your iPhone.",

        "AI in Health Should Be Regulated, But Don’t Forget the Algorithms",

        "Researchers from MIT, Equality AI, and Boston University emphasize the importance of regulating both AI models and traditional algorithms in healthcare. A new commentary published in the NEJM AI highlights the need for oversight to address potential discrimination in patient care decision support tools, including non-automated systems. This follows a final rule under the Affordable Care Act by the U.S. Office for Civil Rights, which prohibits bias in such tools. Developed in response to President Biden's 2023 executive order on safe AI use, the rule reflects the administration's commitment to equity-driven healthcare. Marzyeh Ghassemi, an associate professor at MIT, stated that this step should inspire equitable improvements in both AI and non-AI algorithms, advancing health equity while reducing risks in clinical settings. The rule also builds upon the Biden-Harris administration’s focus on fair, trustworthy AI development in medical contexts.",
